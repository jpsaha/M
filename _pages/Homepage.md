## Goal of <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/">this website</a> (aka Why another website? What is its use?!)

{% details Click here to know %}
- To provide a brief introduction to Mathematical Olympiad.
- To serve as a website for the [MOPSS]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/MOPSS/) program at IISER Bhopal, to be held in person, from August 2024 to November 2024.
  - We have plans to post notes containing the details of those sessions. 
- To provide handouts on the topics of [Algebra]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/Algebra/), [Combinatorics]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/Combinatorics/), [Geometry]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/Geometry/), and [Number Theory]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/NumberTheory/), and to keep it posted in an organized manner across different sub-topics.
  - These notes may be useful to the students who would like to have a look at some of the past RMO problems before getting started, or just curious about it.
  - These notes may also serve as a reference to anyone who would like to provide guidance to students, but may not have enough time to organize the relevant questions across the topics and sub-topics. 
- To provide assistance to anyone on Mathematics Olympiad.

## I am enthusiastic about math/math olympiads and/or teaching math to high schoolers. How may I contribute?

{% details Click here to know %}
- One may reach to schools, to high schoolers.
- One may explain about Olympiads, and spread awareness about it.
- One may encourage people (for instance, students, teachers or anyone enthusiastic/curious about math olympiad) to go through this website (and suggest a careful reading of the homepage!).
- Next, a student interested in math olympiad, may browse through the handouts posted here (this will grow with time).
- A person with passion in teaching high school students could use the handouts as a problem bag, or in other way.
- What else? For instance, if one has interest in a science subject(s) other than (or parallel to) mathematics, then one may refer to the [webpage of HBCSE](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/), which has information about olympiads ([past papers](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/how-to-prepare/past-papers/)) on the following subjects, and may repeat the same process as above adapted to those subjects!
  - Astronomy
  - Biology
  - Chemistry
  - Junior Science
  - Physics
{% enddetails %}

## I do not have much time for the above, but I find it interesting. Is there something that I can do?

{% details Click here to know %}
- Yes! You could spread the message, only if you find it worth doing and willing to do so, by 
  - sharing the link [{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/),
  - and suggeting to go through the homepage [{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/), to find what all this is about!
